<p>This is a simple landing page. In the examples given, this is the page you use to hook victim browsers for exploitation.</p>
<p>Once the browser is hooked here, your BeEF Autorun Rule Engine determines where to forward it: To "iexplore.html" or "other.html"</p>
<p>Obviously you'll want to make this look more convincing than it does now. But remember, the user will only be exposed to it for a second or so before being redirected.</p>
